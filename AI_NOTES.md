For this challenge I used the free Github Copilot version in vscode.
Code completion is turned off due to personal preference.
The Copilot Chat window was used.

# What went well
- Creating a connection to the Shopify API.
- Creating a pydantic model for already received data.
- Creating the GraphQL query by pasting the Documentation in the prompt (AI missed fields).

# What caused trouble
- Trying to transform the output to the excepted json format.

# How I verified outputs
- I don't use code completion. I check manually the code efore copying it form the Copilot Chainto the Code.
